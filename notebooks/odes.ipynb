    "From these maps, it will be straightforward to write down the rate of change of quantities over time. We will denote $dN(t)/dt$ the instantaneous rate of change $dN(t)$ in the quantity $N(t)$ calculated over some infinitely small time window $dt$. One can interpret it as the change in $N(t)$ over a small change in $t$. In other words: $dN(t)/dt$ is the slope of the time series of $N(t)$ at time $t$. And as it turns out, we will be able to recover the unknown time series $N(t)$ from the differential equation $dN(t)/dt$."
